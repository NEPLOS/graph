ummm.... i was bored

A simple program to visually connect points based on user-defined edges using raylib.  
Originally created to avoid manually drawing graphs based on input data (to avoid drawing on paper)

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a series of connections (edges) in the form:

Each line connects the first node to the second. Input `0` or a non-positive number to end input.

2. The program places all nodes evenly spaced in a circle and connects them according to the given edges.

3. A window opens with all nodes and connections visualized using raylib.
